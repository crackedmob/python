# python file has a bunch of python code inside it , so by writing code 
# what we are doing is just giving the computers some instructions
print("   /|")
print("  / |")
print(" /  |")
print("/___|")

# when we click on the run button, python goes into the file we are writing in,
# then it executes the instruction line by line , as python does interpretation, therefore the order of the 
# instructions matter a lot

# statements:
# a program is a list of instructions to be executed by a computer,
# these programming instructions are called statements
# In python , the statements are executed line wise, they are interpreted line-by-line


# semicolon (;), they are optional in python and are used only when youo need 
# to write multiple statements in a single line , and for separating them you use ;


# the print(), requires a dooube or single quote to print anything, otherwise 
# python will give you an error
print("Hi") # double quotes are used
print('Ken') # single quotes are used 
# both of them will print just fine , but if we remove the quotes, we will get an error


# by default python print() function ends with a new line 
# to print multiple words in the same line, we can use end parameter:
print("yooooo", end = " ")
print('wassup?')
# using end will print them in the same line 





# printing numbers :
# it doesn't require numbers to be put inside the quotes to be printed with print() function
print(3)
print(358)

# even doing maths inside the print() function is allowed and possible
print(3 + 5)
print(5 * 7)


# we can mix texts and numbers in the same print() function
print("hello, I'm ", 20, "years old." )
